title: EthanMcBloxxer's Subtitle Etiquette
subtitle: A simple and minimal syntax for writing subtitles
---

- Keep periods on the inside of open/close tags (like this.)
- Never use UPPERCASE for tag insides and use strictly lowercase for sounds
- (sound), [descriptive subtitles], {editorial note}, 𝅘𝅥𝅮 (music name) 𝅘𝅥𝅮, 𝅘𝅥𝅮 lyrics 𝅘𝅥𝅮
- \*thoughts\*
- \*\*shouting\*\* (if possible try not to uppercase or add exclamation points to this)
- Break multiple lines

## Example

EthanMcBloxxer: Welcome to "EthanMcBloxxer's Subtitle Etiquette"!  
This is a multi-line subtitle using a line break.  
Multiple line breaks are also possible.

[10 seconds pass...]

EthanMcBloxxer: The subtitles should say my name again after a break in the media.

Evil Bloxxer: Another person begins to speak, so their name is said.

EthanMcBloxxer: It shouldn't matter too much with who is currently being featured on-screen.  
For perfect practice, say the speaker's name each time they take the last speaker's place.

(clang)

Sounds, descriptive subtitles, and editorial notes don't count as a "speaker", so EthanMcBloxxer was still the last speaker.

{You might now be wondering about music. You should use a unicode note character (preferrably not the whole notes) to wrap the lyrics in.}

𝅘𝅥𝅮 Hey boys, listen up! 𝅘𝅥𝅮  
𝅘𝅥𝅮 Humans aren't such a big deal 𝅘𝅥𝅮  
𝅘𝅥𝅮 Who need tomorrow, anyway? 𝅘𝅥𝅮  
𝅘𝅥𝅮 So don't hide your fists 𝅘𝅥𝅮
