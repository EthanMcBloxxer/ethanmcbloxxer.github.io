Do not make any of the letters here lowercase unless it is required by the computer, in which case you should separate the type from the os with a hyphen `-`.

## Name

Name the device with a short name that summarizes its purpose.

In enterprise situations, using fLast would be a good option, like PCwin-jDoe being a Windows computer owned by John Doe. If preferred, you can also use the full name or add the middle name.

It is recommended to append `.admin`, `.administrator`, or `.sudo` to the **user account name** when there is an alternative account that does not have administrator permissions (and this one does), like when `EthanMcBloxxer` and `EthanMcBloxxer.admin` are both two accounts. Never use a vague `admin` account in enterprise situations. Use a hyphen if a period is unavailable or bad practice.
