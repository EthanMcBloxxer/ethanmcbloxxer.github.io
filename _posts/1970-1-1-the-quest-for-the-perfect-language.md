title: The Quest for the Perfect Language
subtitle: Looking at the top 10 languages and deciding on the best
---

In this post, I'll be looking at the top 10 by native speakers, and seeing which of them meets my set criteria for being a language better than English, or in a way, perfect.

## Criteria:

* No weird grammar rules
* No unnecessary prononciation characters (like the schwa)
* No gendered nouns other than pronouns
* ‚â§ 50 letters/characters (doesn't include diacritics)

## Evaluation

**Heads Up:** [This data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers#Top_languages_by_population) was evaluated from Wikipedia, which explicitly says that it was found in March of 2019. I've also made that explicitly clear throughout the article. If you resent humor, I recommend your discretion.

### Chinese

Just about 12% of the world (in March 2019) speaks Mandarin Chinese. Yet, there's an astronomical amount more than 50 letters/characters. There's more than 100,000. Sorry Chinese, simplify your language a bit.

### Spanish

We have the Spanish language now. This time, there's half as many native speakers as Chinese, at 6% of the world (in March 2019). Unfortunately, they categorize words by gender, -a and -o.

### English

<span class="notranslate">Mi skedyule ahn wenzda = My schedule on wednesday.</span> Just- no.

### Hindi

At a smaller portion, only 4.4% of people speak it (in March 2019), but this is instantly disqualified as well because it has 52 characters. Gosh darnit.

### Bengali

Pronounced "bong luh", a mere 3% of the world (in March 2019) speak this language (98% of those speakers are Bangladeshis). Now I say mere, but 3% of the world (in July 2019 üòè) was 7547858925, or 7.5 billion, and 3% of that is 226435767, or 226-230 million. So it's probably safe to say a few people speak it. Now, with all this useless information, you'd probably expect me to tell you that this is a really good language, but instead I'm going to tell you that it's utter garbage. It's got 11 fricking vowels (actually this doesn't matter, English also has 11, but it's got more characters to remember.), and 51 total characters. Well... unfortunately, this language is disqualified.

### Portuguese

Yes! It's that one language that most applications put as a quick pick, even though you could never learn it in school. You know, that one with a weird √™. Apparently 2.8% of the world speaks it (in March 2019). Cool. Well, it actually isn't that bad. It has tonal questions, English word categorization, and gendered nouns... wait. Checking sources...

All nouns have a gender, eh? Disqualified.

### Russian

Ra-ra-raspu-- oh. Hi. It's Russian. That one cool language that makes you sound like a guy wearing a fur hat. It's got, on the dot, 2.000% of the world speaking it (in March 2019). For starters, to pronounce the name, you say something along the lines of [drrusskiy yeezik](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Ru-russkiy_jizyk.ogg). 33 characters, one of them sounding like "e crap kay" and another sounding like "[dvourdesnuk](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Russian_%D0%AA_pronunciation.ogg)", it's great, it's cool, and it's... already disqualified. Stop putting in gendered nouns, people!

### Japanese

It's Japanese, the language everyone thinks of alongside Chinese when asked to provide non-Indo-European languages, because nobody cares about Hindi, Korean, Greek, or Russian. I actually tried learning a bit of it, and it's actually great. 1.665% of the world (in March 2019) speak it, so it's decently established. **And hey lookat dat nouns aren't gendered**. So, how cool is this language, and do we have a winner? No. Definitely not. They use Kanji. I'm sorry everyone. Japanese doesn't have spaces, so they use Chinese in order to differentiate words. I'm dissapointed. Oh yeah, and there are a few stupid grammar rules too. Like doubling consonants. You use a <ruby>„Å£ <rp>(</rp><rt>Small Tsu</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> to double a consonant such as <ruby>„Åç <rp>(</rp><rt>Ki</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>, making it <ruby>„Å£„Åç <rp>(</rp><rt>K Ki</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>. Like in <ruby>„Åå„Å£„Åç <rp>(</rp><rt>Ga K Ki</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>. However, if your "„Åç" happens to be a "„Çì", you use a normal <ruby>„Çì <rp>(</rp><rt>N</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>, meaning <ruby>„Çì„Å´ <rp>(</rp><rt>N Ni</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> is valid, which basically means <ruby>„ÅÇ„Çì„Å™„ÅÑ <rp>(</rp><rt>A N Na I</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> is used with the „Çì instead of a „Å£, which would instead be <ruby>„ÅÇ„Å£„Å™„ÅÑ <rp>(</rp><rt>A N Na I</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>. Basically, if the character's consonant is an "n", then use „Çì instead of „Å£ for no reason. Oh yeah, then it's also got Katakana, which I honestly would've forgiven. It's like an import for other languages. For example, my name in Japanese is <ruby>„Ç§„Éº„Çµ„É≥„Éñ„Ç°„ÇØ„Çµ <rp>(</rp><rt>I I Sa N Bua Ku Sa</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>.

### Punjabi

My first reaction to looking at this language was "what the heck is this?". According to Wikipedia, it's the language of Pakistan, and has 1.2% speaking it (in March 2019). I suppose that makes sense. It's got 35 traditional characters, but different writing systems, which are in use.. with different religious groups? *What?* I think it's because it's in both Pakistan and India? Okay, I'll just say that it counts as more than 50 characters.. **what is this *language*...**

### Marathi

This is it, folks. The final language in the top ten (in March 2019). Well, well. Already, they dodged a disqualification bullet. There are 46 characters. Oh, wait. Gendered nouns. Nevermind. I shot another bullet with a silent pistol. Disqualified.

### Telugu

I'm only doing this to make sure that the 11th language isn't the best language in the world. It's got... 5... 1... characters. And gendered nouns.

## Conclusion

At least in the top ~~10~~ **11** languages, there's no decent language that is well-established, actually makes sense, and is easy to learn. You might be able to compromise on this, but for the time being, it doesn't exist yet. I encourage you to make your own language with any free time you have. It doesn't need to be widespread, but the world needs a language with good criteria:

* No weird grammar rules
* No unnecessary prononciation characters (like the schwa)
* No gendered nouns other than pronouns
* ‚â§ 50 letters/characters (doesn't include diacritics)
* Affixes
* Non-gendered pronoun
* Absolute direction??? Maybe? I don't know.
* Spaces
* Remove certain English grammar symbols
* Vowels, and vowels. Refer to an [IPA chart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/IPA_chart_2020.svg) for easy-to-pronounce vowels and LABEL THEM ACCORDINGLY, don't reuse all vowels for one, like English does
* Spell things properly, no silent letters like e
* Use capitals right
* Make each letter/symbol with a capitol variant a replica, like Kk, Mm, Nn, Oo, Ss, Uu, Vv, Ww, Xx, Yy, and Zz
* NAME IT SOMETHING COOL

most of these are optional.
