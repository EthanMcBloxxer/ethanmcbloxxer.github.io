# Hey, I'm Ethan.

I'm EthanMcBloxxer, a programmer, gamer, and photoshopper. I skipped first grade and have had experience with coding for quite a while. I can speak English, Spanish, and a bit of Japanese.

I don't reveal my face or age because I like to stay somewhat anonymous while expressing myself. I like getting credit for what I do, but not messing anything up or wasting anyone's time. I first learned to program in QBasic and HTML as use GIMP for image manipulation. I've have been into programming since, but also played Minecraft and Roblox before I started doing so. I watch anime, which started after I began to study Japanese (I wanted to learn the easiest, most widespread non indo-euoropean (non-latin based) langauge). I wanted to get to know the culture and looked up first-time animes, and settled on [ERASED](https://www.crunchyroll.com/erased).

## Programming

In general, I have experience with C#, C++, Lua/LuaU, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, jQuery, YAML, and QBasic. I might also know some abstract languages, even more so then QBasic, which, let's be honest, you probably haven't even heard of.

I think it started when I wanted to program and looked into options. I was running a [DOS emulator](https://dosbox.com/) at the time to gain experience with Hero's Quest and MULE (I heard they were good, they actually are), so I downloaded QBasic and printed out a Wikipedia guide for doing it. It seemed like DOS games would be a good place to start.

In QBasic, I made [something I called "MENU" (I'm not that creative)](https://gist.github.com/EthanMcBloxxer/96324f68826998345addf762e9f10ddd), which housed things like a text-based RPG (based on Adventure, I think), a calculator, and a drawn triangle (not mine), with some other additional things.

I then left programming for a bit afterwards since I lost the file, probably wiping my computer (I do this sometimes), and got demotivated.  
That happens a lot.

Anyways, I decided to get into HTML after half a year or so, because I saw [some of my relatives knew how to use it](https://gist.github.com/EthanMcBloxxer/a415aee158f42bae0326db1e689b0d47). Luckily, they had most of the scaffolding already in place, so I just needed to learn the math beind `<div>`s and procrastinate learning JavaScript.

I opted for [a w3schools-made template](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_startup.htm) [shortly after](https://ethanmcbloxxer.github.io/ethansware/index.html), as it looked quite a bit better. I filled the menu with a ton of random things, and copied a ton of code from [DynamicDrive](http://www.dynamicdrive.com). Why not?

Quite a bit later, I went to a class to learn more about programming, but they taught [GameMaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker). Even being a significant upgrade from my school, who taught us [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), it wasn't [Unity](https://unity.com).

And I knew Unity existed, so I didn't really care about the class too much. In fact, I still had a incredibly low-end Lenovo Yoga at the time. Surprisingly, Unity didn't lag, and I found [Jimmy Vegas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRMXHQ2rJ9_0CHS7mhL7erg). I copied everything he did until a certain episode. I was *learning*.

I basically quit coding at this point, and instead built my own computer. That took a month or two. Sadly, the main reason for my doing this was because I needed a higher-end computer for gaming, not coding.

Inevitably, though, while I was playing Roblox and Satisfactory at this time, I started to create games with it, and found my specialty in creating GUIs. I made [a classic game revamp](https://web.roblox.com/games/5275272974/Crossroads-Hub) and [a store to house my virtual clothing](https://web.roblox.com/games/5266723360/Epix-Store). Of course, I ended up abandoning the project because I didn't know what ZIndex was, and that makes GUI creation insanely difficult. Not to mention that the actual window system I made was complete and utter garbage..

So, because I knew LuaU, I got into exploiting Roblox for a while. Because I was actually intelligent at this point, I successfully installed... Vega X. The worst exploit possible. JJSploit was better than this garbage. I got it from a person exploiting who had Discord, so I had the worst exploit, and the worst script. It wasn't looking good, but after a while I decided to trash it and make my own.

So, C#. I segwayed myself into programming in Visual Studio, in WinForms. The exploit was never finished, but [it still resides on my GitHub profile](https://github.com/EthanMcBloxxer/BloxsploitWF) after porting it a while after discontinuing it, as Bitdefender deleted most of the important stuff.

I began on a project I didn't have a name for at the time, but is now called RoForums.

Afterwards, I started looking into ways to make my own website. I found [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). And [Beautiful-Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/). So I got into coding again, and I also began to create [a bunch of Gists with spare code](https://gist.github.com/EthanMcBloxxer).

But, after a YouTuber ([Sim8n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ7-1YtZol0)) covered my (currently unnamed RoForums) on his channel, and the project blew up.  
By 25 people.

Well, it's more than I would have expected. Because I didn't really want to work on it at the time, I [open-sourced it on GitHub](https://github.com/EthanMcBloxxer/RoForums), which you can also still find.

I named it RoForums, but there already existed a website called RoForums, so I needed to distinguish it. I went to the [Wiki](https://roforums.fandom.com/wiki/Roforums_Wiki) (since the actual website is discontinued), and said:

> Since the site is now offline, EthanMcBloxxer has taken "RoForums" as the name for a game to recreate the forums inside of a Roblox Game. You can see more on [the RoForums (game) website](https://ethanmcbloxxer.github.io/RoForums/).

Bam. It's called RoForums now.

I continued to do what I know, and kept putting off learning C++ until April 2021, where I began to learn C++ off of [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/).

## Gaming

I started gaming very young. And got pretty addicted.

I would often play *just* [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) for hours, and only played peaceful. I resided in a village, and gave myself a bed with cheating. That's all I did for the longest time (that I can remember). I did also play SkyWars on [The Hive](https://www.hivemc.com/), when it was still cool. I was terrible at it. I didn't win, once.

I also had a neighboring friend who showed me [Roblox](https://roblox.com/) while playing [Jailbreak](https://web.roblox.com/games/606849621/). I decided to make an account on it called `ilove_superdogs`, with a terrible password. I was told I should've set my username as my password, and my password as my username. I now agree.

Anyways, I changed my username **much** later under the influence of ReeseMcBlox and the "Bloxxer" badge and t-shirt.

Additionally to my Roblox-playing, I also played console games, like Plants vs Zombies.

I got into [Astroneer](https://astroneer.space/), and a channel called [Z1Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMPpVtxOI8RtfurfvCcxgyA), who introduced me into [Satisfactory](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/) (which I bought but didn't have a good enough computer until later).

I also had a friend show me [Bloons TD 6](https://store.steampowered.com/app/960090/Bloons_TD_6/), which induced my memory of [CoolMathGames](https://www.coolmathgames.com/), where I played Bloons TD 5. I played that some, but it was never really a main thing.

At some point along the line, I got a Nintendo Switch, and [Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/). I was insanely into it for really not wanting to try it for some time. I quite enjoy the series now.

Much later, after going back to Roblox and (now modded) Minecraft and [SkyFactory 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/ftb-presents-skyfactory-3) (I do this sometimes), the [Among Us](https://www.innersloth.com/gameAmongUs.php) craze was in full effect.

Because of my exploiting with Roblox, I had a contact that gave me a pirated version of the game when the source was leaked. I played it a little bit, and didn't really understand the craze. I now have a legitimate copy, as Epic Games gave it away for free.

I was also later introduced to [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/) by my stepsister. I got it from Epic Games, as this was about the time Season 2.1 was in full effect. I started to play it all the time, and got okay skills. I'm still a Platinum 1 in 1v1s, but have a Diamond 3's MMR in casual. I guess it was my teammates all along.

## Photoshop

I first learned about [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) when I was in my first state of making HTML. I needed to polish some assets, and downloaded it. I really had no idea what I was doing, since I have this bad habit of not reading the manual. I couldn't even export the image to PNG without looking up a tutorial. That extent of talent is long gone, I can now almost professionally create images with it. Just see my logos now. That's not actually all I used GIMP for, there was also this time when I was creating digital clothing on Roblox for money, and I normally used GIMP and paint.net for that.

## Modeling

I'm terrible at modeling. Why is this a section? I tried it for Roblox and Unity. It... didn't work out.

## Behind the Name & Logo

### The Name

I heard that "Bloxxer" was actually a term for "Killer" on Roblox (online gaming platform). After I learned you could use their FMOD (Unity-like) editor to create games with Lua, I decided to base my name off of it. Even better, there were exploits out there that helped me learn C# and want to learn C++. That's a pretty decent turning point from when I first started learning QBasic and HTML. What would I base my name off of there? EthanQB? Basiq? My literal name (ew)?

### The Logo

My friends continuously tell me that this is a bad logo, but I don't really think I could make anything better (or at least don't have ideas for anything better). It takes inspiration from the Awesome Face meme since my Roblox character wears the Epic Face mask (which doesn't include eyes). That's why there aren't any eyes, okay?
