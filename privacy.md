**This website is hosted with [GitHub](https://github.com/)'s "[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)" and [GitHub's privacy policy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement) is also in effect everywhere on this website.**

We use [Amplitude Analytics](https://amplitude.com).

It collects your country (such as The US), language (such as English), and OS platform/carrier (such as Windows or iPhone/Verizon) anonymously, which is deleted after 90 days.

You can opt-out by enabling [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) or the similar [Global Privacy Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track#Global_Privacy_Control), selecting the "do not track" button in the footer on some pages, or executing `amplitude.getInstance().setOptOut(true);`.

To delete your Amplitude data prior to the 90-day period, email [ethanmcbloxxer@protonmail.com](mailto:ethanmcbloxxer@protonmail.com?subject=Delete%20my%20Amplitude%20Data) with <span id="js-deviceid"><script type="text/javascript">try {document.getElementById("js-deviceid").innerHTML = amplitude.getInstance().options.deviceId + " as the email body.";} catch (e) {document.getElementById("js-deviceid").innerHTML = "Whoops, it looks like you already turned off Amplitude or have something enabled. Don't send this email!"}</script></span>
