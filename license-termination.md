# License Termination
<!-- Excluding [`file.name`](), -->
The file or files created, modified, or removed in this commit and the revisions of said files are not licensed under the repository's default license ([CC by NC-ND 4](https://github.com/EthanMcBloxxer/.public/blob/main/license.md)). If they were previously, the license is revoked and replaced with a new one.

## Reasons
1. These file(s) could already be under a different license. If this is the case, the license may be included inside of the commit's description or title.
2. I may wish for the file(s) to have more public grants. This is mostly on files deemed to be software source code.
3. The file(s) might be work in which I require a specific license, such as compiled binaries that I'd like to stay compiled.
4. I might want the files to be in the public domain with no credit needed to me whatsoever.

This is a template that isn't custom-made for this specific case, so there might be another unspecified reason why I might be revoking the license.

## I Will
* Respect all change, takedown, or removal requests from the original and current copyright holder;
* Allow the copyright holder to change the license that these file(s) are licensed under;
* Follow all conditions that the *original* license requires me to unless or additionally at the discretion of the copyright holder;
* Change the file(s) inside of the current revision of the repository accordingly to these points; and
* Not revoke the commit that contains the file(s) unless required to by the copyright holder and will revise them with an additional commit instead

If the license is not specified in the following places:

* The commit name
* The commit description
* A file the commit contains
* A comment by EthanMcBloxxer on the commit
* This document

then you can assume that no rights are granted to you to use the file(s) and they are reserved to the original copyright holder, or, in the absence of one as well, the repository owner.
