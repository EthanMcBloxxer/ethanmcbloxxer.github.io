You're a Rocket League veteran or a newer player to the game, and you want to understand how the ranks in competitive mode work.  
Well, for each different competitive mode you play, you get a different rank. You must play 10 matches in order to get your rank in the first place, otherwise you are unranked.  
You can tell roughly what rank you are at the end of your games, if there are higher-ranked players than you will be higher-ranked.

Anyways, after your 10 games, you will place into one of the following:

* Bronze
* Silver
* Gold
* Platinum

<small>the following are very uncommon to get placed in after getting ranked</small>

* Diamond
* Champion
* Grand Champion
* Supersonic Legend

All of these categories are divided into 3 divisions, except Supersonic Legend.  
So, what does this mean?  
Technically, your rank is just a visible representation of your Matchmaking Rank (MMR).  
MMR is what Rocket League actually uses in order to put you into matches with other players that have similar skill level to you.

If you see other players with special icons and you are unsure of what they are, there is a chart of them below.
