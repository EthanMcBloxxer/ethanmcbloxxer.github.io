This is a general guide on how to exploit in Roblox created by H3x0r or OpenGamerTips. Keep in mind that some things here are oversimplified for the *average* skid.  
If you are looking to troubleshoot then scroll to the bottom.

## Risks

You are breaking [Roblox’s Terms of Service](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203312450) if you choose to exploit.  
<small>*Editor's Note: That's pretty darn stupid, some exploits aren't "unfair to all Roblox players".</small>

Most exploits are undetectable and keep you from getting banned on attaching (Anti-Taint) but you must keep in mind that reports sent to moderators will get you banned.  
Try to not make it look obvious if you exploit.    

## Hacking vs Exploiting

You may think that exploiting is the same as hacking, and you are partly correct.  
Hacking uses exploiting but hacking is more related to messing around in someone’s computer with permission (White Hat), or doing it for fun without (Black Hat).  
Hacking also revolves more around network vulnerabilities.  
Exploiting is unethical while hacking can be ethical.  
So don’t be an idiot and call someone a hacker.  

## Memory and Exploiting Usage

You know that your computer has RAM, it's a rectangular stick that you put in your computer and it can sometimes make the computer run smoother.  
RAM stands for random access memory.  
Memory is just a fancy word for RAM.  
There are spots in the RAM where data is stored, kind of like a game’s health for your character.  
These are called addresses.  
An address is stored as a hexadecimal value, which basically is base-16, or a system of ‘0123456789ABCDEF’.  
For example, the number 1000 in hex form is 3E8.  
What if I just set the health value to 100 over and over?  
I would have god mode.  

## Why is Roblox different?

Roblox is based on Lua which is a language that can be embedded [put] in any application.  
Roblox also modified Lua and calls it LuaU which is bad news for exploiters because some methods for cheating that were used before all the time are now patched.  
If it was as simple to set a value in your memory [RAM], everyone would be making an exploit.  
There is also another issue that Roblox has, but it’s easily bypassed: Retcheck.  
If you don’t bypass retcheck you will get kicked from the game because you are exploiting.  
It’s basically constantly checking for an unexpected change in the RAM.  

## Security Contexts
This is the thing the basic skid doesn’t understand well.  
Levels are the same as the security context of an exploit or a script.  

Level 1 is the first and least trusted level to Roblox. It has barely any permissions.  
Level 2 contains ServerScripts and LocalScripts.  
Level 3 is the context level of user actions in the explorer on Roblox.  
Level 4 Scripts are Roblox's Scripts (made by Roblox).  
Level 5 Scripts on Roblox’s games are level 5.  
Level 6 is the context the command bar in Roblox Studio uses.  
Level 7 was taken away from Roblox, but has been brought back and isn’t used in Roblox.  
Level 8 used to be a thing and was very unstable, but it’s gone. Level 8+ execution is impossible.  
Level 6 and 7 have the exact same permissions, so there is no point in increasing to level seven.  

Serversided execution does NOT have anything to do with level 7.  
Serversided execution is ALWAYS level 2.  
Don’t be retarded and say serversides have higher levels.  

## Filtering Enabled (FE)
Probably the thing that pisses me off the most is people not knowing what FE is.  
FE is the replication boundary between the server and client (Clients that do unexpected things don’t show up to others).  
For example, say I have an exploit and I spawned 100 parts.  
Nobody else will see the parts and if I rejoin the server the parts won’t be there.  
Now, say I have a serverside and I did the same thing.  
That will show up to all players because the server did it.  
You can delete things in your character and it will show up, FE allows that.  

## Roblox Lua and How Exploits Work
As I said back a few paragraphs, Lua is an embedded language.  
This means it can be added to a program.  
Now how does execution work?  
Well, there are a lot of things that Roblox does to execute.  
It’s all in the Roblox Lua VM.  
I will not go deep into the VM because it goes to opcodes and things more low level and harder to understand.  
Basically, first it converts your code into Lua C, which is the C++ representation of Lua.  
If you played around with Lua C, you may know functions like ‘call’, ‘setfield’, ‘getfield’, ‘pushnil’, ‘createtable’, etc.  
These are sort of how the opcodes work after the VM converts your code.  
If I wanted to change my WalkSpeed, here’s some beautiful code for doing exactly that:  
```lua
game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Humanoid.WalkSpeed = 100
```

Now here’s what the VM turns it into:
```lua
emptystack
getglobal game
getfield -1 Players
getfield -1 LocalPlayer
getfield -1 Character
getfield -1 Humanoid
pushnumber 100
setfield -1 WalkSpeed
```
This looks pretty complicated, amirite? It is. So what does the compiler do now?  
It does even more conversion, but that’s where it gets deep, so I won’t get that far.  
Now, How can an exploit use this? Well, we have to get all the addresses for getfield, setfield, and other things like that.  
After that we can convert the code and fire those addresses.


## Choosing an Exploit
Always, and I mean ALWAYS, an exploit that is paid is higher quality in execution than a free one. It may change but right now in 2020 it hasn’t.
I highly recommend a paid exploit as it can do WAY more stuff than a free one can. Here's a table for them:

| Free | Freemium* | Paid |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| [JJSploit](https://wearedevs.net/dinfo/JJSploit) | [KRNL](https://wearedevs.net/dinfo/Krnl) | [Synapse X](https://x.synapse.to/) |
| [Coco Z](https://wearedevs.net/d/Coco%20Z) | [Fluxus](https://www.fluxusteam.xyz/) | [ProtoSmasher](https://protosmasher.net/) |
| [Yoink](https://wearedevs.net/d/Yoink%20Executor) | [Shadow](https://wearedevs.net/d/Shadow) | [Sentinel](https://rblxexploits.com/sentinel) |
| [Skisploit](https://wearedevs.net/dinfo/Skisploit) |  | [Calamari](https://calamari.cc/) |

*Freemium means there is a key system, or a linkvertise/adfly page you have to complete in order to use the exploit.

## Exploit Problem Troubleshooting
First things first, if you use the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/roblox/9nblgggzm6wm) version of Roblox, THE. EXPLOIT. WILL. NOT. FIND. ROBLOX. Get the native Roblox application.<br/>
Roblox may have updated. If it’s Wednesday, you will have to wait for the developers of your exploit to get addresses again. Even if it isn’t Wednesday, Roblox might have unexpectedly updated.<br/>
You may have compatibility mode on! Turn it off as it breaks a LOT of exploits.<br/>
Most, if not all exploits, require Windows 10. If you don’t have it, get it! It’s free so you have no excuse.<br/>
Ok let’s say you have Windows 10. Your exploit still doesn’t work. You may have to install [redistributables](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) which are used across all programs in your computer.<br/>
Still? Turn off your antivirus. Not just Windows Defender. All the antiviruses you have. If you can’t turn it off, delete it!<br/>
The exploit may be broken. Try another one and see if that works.<br/>
Crappy computers = No working exploits. Get a better PC.<br/>
Your last option may be to reset your PC. This will remove all your data so do this at your own risk.<br/>
