Have you ever wanted to type accent marks for multilingual typing?
Today, I'll teach you about an integrated Windows feature to do just that by simply typing the accent (' " \` ~ ^) and then the proceeding character.  

You can also type other symbols with CTRL+ALT+$key, and those are as follows: äåé®þüúíóöáßðøæ©ñµ¡²³¤€¼½¾‘’¥×¿ç.  
Now, how do I do this?
Well, it's actually surprisingly easy.
First, open Settings by holding down the Windows key and then I, or ⊞+I.
Then, navigate to Time & Language > Language.
Now, under preferred languages, click your current language (probably English (United States)) and then Options. Scroll all the way to the bottom to find Keyboards.
Click "Add a keyboard" and click where it says United States-International.
You can now swap between keyboard types by holding down the Windows key and pressing spacebar (⊞+SPCE), or by holding the CTRL key and pressing Shift.
There's also a new icon on your taskbar near the date and time that shows what keyboard you currently have active.
Remember, to actually type the marks you just press ', ", \`, ~, or ^ and then the character you want to have that mark.
If you don't want any character to have that mark, press the spacebar or switch keyboards.
If you want to type other symbols (äåé®þüúíóöáßðøæ©ñµ¡²³¤€¼½¾‘’¥×¿ç) then hold either the right ALT key or both right CTRL and ALT keys, then press another key.
For convenience, there is a table below of every key and it's INTL conversion.
