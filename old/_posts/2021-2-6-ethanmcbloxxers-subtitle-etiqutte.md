title: EthanMcBloxxer's Subtitle Etiquette
subtitle: A simple and minimal syntax for writing subtitles
tags: [utility]
---

### Basic reference:
- Keep periods on the inside of open/close tags (like this.)
- Never use UPPERCASE for tag insides, use only lowercase for sounds
- (sound), [descriptive subtitles], {editorial note}
- Use hyphens for continued speech or a screened character
- "Quotes mean someone's talking, but we don't know who..."
- *thoughts*
- **shouting** (if possible try not to uppercase or add exclamation points to this)


### Example reference:

[You are facing a stage.]

Bob (to your right): This is how a person speaks.  
\- A new line or sentence is marked with a hyphen.

Alice (to your left): If the character is on the screen, you don't have to say their name, unlike us.

(clang)

\- Say, did you hear that? Noises are put in parentheses, all lowercase.

[Bob walks onto the stage.]

Bob: If Alice was talking just now, then my name should be displayed.  
\- Scene changes overwrite who was last speaking.

"Quotes are used when the audience is supposed to be unsure of who's talking.  
\- Put the closing period inside the quotes, and don't close them till the unknown is done speaking."

{Curly braces can be used for inline notes, like a quick editorial note. Keep the period on the inside.}

\- Now that Mr. Mysterious has stopped talking, and I, Bob, am the only one on the screen, this means we can use hyphens again.

Alice: Oh, now, Bob.  
\- Keep in mind that this hyphen means that I'm taking.  
\- And, also remember that a single person can take up multiple hyphens.  
\- We'll need to display Bob's name again after this if he starts talking.

Bob: Well, goodie.

[Bob walks off the stage.]

\- Because nobody else started talking, it doesn't matter that I left the screen.  
\- Also, if you didn't notice, most descriptive subtitles are kept in normal brackets.  
\- Additionally, every tag has the period within it instead of after it.  
\- Plus, simple apostrophes {Bob means these: '} are omitted.  
\- You can use them in place of quotes, but that's ill-advised.  
\- *Asterisks or Italics/Emphasized text means that the character is thinking.  
\- Don't forget the hyphen!*  
\- **Likewise, two asterisks or Bold/Strong text conveys shouting.**
