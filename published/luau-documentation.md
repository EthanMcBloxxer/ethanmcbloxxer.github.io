## Primitive

### Scripts

Scripts are the core of Roblox's engine, and where Luau actually runs inside of Roblox.

To make one, go into your Explorer menu (View â†’ Explorer) and hover over ServerScriptService. Right click on it and then click on `Insert Object...`. Search for just "Script", and click on `Script`. You should now be in the script editor. If you ever leave the script editor you can get back into it by double clicking on the script you want to edit.

On Roblox, "Script"s run on the server and "LocalScript"s run on the client. Scripts can run in Workspace, but this is only for compatibility with some features like Tools. **Never put Scripts in Workspace**. ServerScriptService is the proper alternative which does not allow exploiters to scan for vulnerabilities in your code.

### LocalScripts

LocalScripts function the same way as Scripts, but they only run on the local computer. These are often used for GUIs and other scenarios which you would need to send data from the client to server. This is possible with Remote Events & Functions, but that is outside the scope of this section.

### Variables

A variable is something that can be referenced and changed with assignments. They are always case-sensitive.

There are (technically) two ways to create them:

```lua
local variable = "data"
-- or
variable = "data"
```

`local` is a keyword that represents a locally-scoped variable. Think of `let` in JavaScript. It only exists in the current function (which includes functions, ifs, loops, etc) or, in the absense of one, across the entire script.

When there is no keyword, it creates a globally-scoped variable (`var` in JavaScript). You can use this new variable throughout the entire running script.

Locally scoped variables are always preferred. Conversely to JavaScript (which is just an example language to compare to), locally-scoped variables offer a hefty (30%+) performance boost over globally scoped ones.

If you need to, you can initiate a variable without a value:

```lua
local variable
```

Luau will warn you that this is unnecessary until you use it later. Doing

```lua
local variable = nil
```

Will silence this warning, as `nil` is just the absense of a value (think `null` in most other languages). Not assigning a value is the same as assigning `nil`.

Assignment also permits variables being assigned to other variables in place of a data type.

```lua
local a = 1
local b = a

print(a) --> 1
print(b) --> 1
```

### Datatypes

Luau also contains many different types of data to use. As previously mentioned, there are only two ways to make a variable. This means that strings aren't prefixed with `string`, numbers not `int`, `float`, or `double`, etc.

The primitive and most used values are as follows:

* nil (`nil`)
* boolean (`true` / `false`)
* number (`13209` and `042389.0239`)
* string (`"Hello"`, `'Hello'`, and `[[Hello]]`)
* function (`function() end`)
* table (`{"array item", "array item"}`, `{key = "value", item = "content"}`)
* userdata (other type)

Roblox additionally has other custom data types like `Color3`, `Vector2`, `CFrame`s, `Instance`s, [and more](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/data-types).

#### `nil`

`nil`, as aforementioned, is the absense of a value (like `null`).

Don't assign this with instances (or their Parent), though: there exists a method called "Destroy" which is a better alternative that moves the instance and its children to `nil`, locks the parent property, and disconnects all connections. This will be built on in a later section.

#### `boolean`

Either on or off, `true` or `false`. They can be used with ifs and conditional statements. In Luau, a value **not** either `false` or `nil` will evaluate to true and is considered truthy. `0`, `""`, etc. evaluate to true.

Operators can be used in conditional statements to evaluate booleans in a different way.

##### `==`

True when both provided operands are equivalent to one another.

```lua
if 2 + 3 == 5 then
	print("2 + 3 = 5")
end
```

##### `~=`

True when both provided operands are **not** equivalent to one another.

```lua
if 5 ~= 3 then
	print("5 is not 3")
end
```

Often mistaken for `!=` from other languages.

##### `>`

Greater than.

##### `<`

Less than.

##### `>=`

Greater than or equal to.

##### `<=`

Less than or equal to.

##### `and`

Returns the first argument if it is false or nil, otherwise it returns the second argument.

##### `or`

If the first value is neither false nor nil, the or operator returns the first value. If the first value is false or nil, then it returns the second value.

This can be used with assignments like so:

```lua
local x = y or 0
print(x) --> 0 (as `y` is `nil`)
```

##### `not`

Returns true if the argument is false or nil, otherwise false.

#### `number`

Any number falls under this type, which may be new if you know other languages. Integers, doubles, and floats are all a part of this type. If needed, you can still check whether the number is an integer with math functions:

```lua
if x ~= math.ceil(x) then
	print(x, "is not an integer!")
end
```

#### `string`

Strings are strands of text. They can be made using either quotes (`""`), apostrophes (`''`), or double brackets (`[[]]`). Conversely to C++, apostrophes do not denote a singular character.

#### `function`

Functions are types that can be called on with *arguments*, which can be accepted by the function in the form of *parameters*.

```lua
local variable = function(param1)
	print(param1)
end

variable("arg1") --> "arg1"
```

Semantically, functions are made using `function variable()` instead of `variable = function()`. The latter is assigning `variable` to an anonymous function (a function without a name, often provided to other functions since functions can be arguments) instead of making a function called `variable`.

Always prefer the following:

```lua
local function variable(param1)
	print(param1)
end

variable("arg1") --> "arg1"
```

This syntax also allows you to use methods in more advanced object-orientated programming.

#### `table`

A table can be created with two curly brackets (`{}`) and assigned to inside of the brackets or with dot syntax. Table values can contain **any** datatype inside of them.

Note that `table` is a reserved Lua Library and you cannot name a variable "`table`".

##### Arrays

Arrays are tables when you simply need to store an array of values, like the current nonplayer characters inside of a game. In this case, you could do the following:

```lua
local myTable = {
	workspace.NPC1,
	workspace.NPC2,
	workspace.NPC3,
}
```

and you'd have an array. This is only really useful when you iterate through it, but you can also get the values with bracket syntax like so:

```lua
print(myTable[2]) --> workspace.NPC2
```

##### Dictionaries

Dictionaries are tables where each value has a given key, like `Cash`, `Gems`, etc.

```lua
local myTable = {
	Cash = 500,
	Gems = 20, -- the comma can be omitted on the final value
}

myTable.ActiveBoost = "Sprint"

print(myTable.Cash) --> 500
print(myTable["Cash"]) --> 500
print(myTable.ActiveBoost) --> "Sprint"
print(myTable["ActiveBoost"]) --> "Sprint"
```

If needed, you can use bracket syntax to define a key or index the table with a spaced name (or reserved keyword!) or in place of dot syntax:

```lua
local myTable = {
	["Cash and Cents"] = 500.4,
	["Active Boost"] = "Sprint",
	["if"] = true,
}

print(myTable.Cash and Cents) --> SYNTAX ERROR
print(myTable["Cash and Cents"]) --> 500.4
print(myTable.Active Boost) --> SYNTAX ERROR
print(myTable["Active Boost"]) --> "Sprint"
print(myTable.if) --> SYNTAX ERROR
print(myTable["if"]) --> true
```

#### `userdata`

Denotes a custom Roblox type. You can also create your own with the [`newproxy()`](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/what-is-newproxy-and-what-is-it-good-for/184454) function, but that requires extensive knowledge of types and metatables.

#### `type()`

`type` is a type-checking function that returns the primitive type of its only argument, as a string.

```lua
type("hello") --> "string"
type("1948") --> "string"
type(49318) --> "number"
type(Instance.new("Model")) --> "userdata"
```

#### `typeof()`

`typeof` is a Luau extension to `type` that also allows for custom parsing of userdata, or custom types. `type` is still useful when you only need to know if the argument is one of the primitive data types, since `type` is generally faster than `typeof`.

```lua
typeof("hello") --> "string"
typeof("1948") --> "string"
typeof(49318) --> "number"
typeof(Instance.new("Model")) --> "Instance"
```

### ModuleScripts

These are extremely simple to understand on a basic level. There is a deeper level of understanding you can achieve, but you don't need to have an immense amount of understanding to use these.

Now, to be blunt, ModuleScripts are functions.

That's it.

Inside of a ModuleScript, you may notice there is a `return` keyword at the end. This is what gets returned when using the `require` keyword.

Say I have the following code in a ModuleScript:

```lua
return "This is a ModuleScript"
```

and this in a Script:

```lua
local module = require(ModuleScript) -- (replace ModuleScript with path)
print(module) --> "This is a ModuleScript"
```

In the Script, you call the ModuleScript and the ModuleScript returns `"This is a ModuleScript"`. That return value is stored in the `module` variable, which we print.

The ModuleScript's code can be thought of more like this:

```lua
function module()
	return "This is a ModuleScript"
end
```

Most use ModuleScripts with tables as return values, like so:

```lua
return {
	say = function(text)
		print(text)
	end,
	addCash = function(player, cash)
		player.leaderstats.Cash.Value += cash -- this is just an example
	end,
}
```

which allows us to do this in Scripts:

```lua
local module = require(ModuleScript)

module.say("Some text is cool") --> "Some text is cool"
module.addCash(game.Players.EthanMcBloxxer, 1000)
```

you may also see table assignments like this, which also works:

```lua
local exports = {}

exports.say(text)
	print(text)
end

return exports
```

and some even utilize Metatables.

Another thing to note is that code inside of the ModuleScript will be ran. Functions inside of them don't run automatically (as functions don't run without being called), so you can make code inside of the ModuleScript run on calling:

```lua
print("Ran ModuleScript")

return true
```

which would do the following in a Script:

```lua
local bool = require(ModuleScript) --> Ran ModuleScript
print(tostring(bool)) --> true
```

## Functions

### Metatables

This article is very oversimplified and doesn't touch many small details.

Think of metatables like normal Roblox "Events". The only difference is that you don't use `:Connect` and instead assign the value to a function. This is because metatables **are** just tables with the events (metamethods) assigned to functions.

To set a metatable to a table, use the `setmetatable` function, like this:

```lua
local Table = {
  Cash = 100
}
local Metatable = {
  __call = function()
    return "A table was called!"
  end
}

setmetatable(Table, Metatable)

print(Table())       --> "A table was called!"
print(Table["Cash"]) --> 100
```

you can also do this, which does the same thing:

```lua
local Table = setmetatable(
  { -- table
    Cash = 100
  }, -- notice the comma
  { -- metatable
    __call = function()
      return "A table was called!"
    end
  }
)

print(Table())       --> "A table was called!"
print(Table["Cash"]) --> 100
```

As you can see, the "Metatable" table has a `__call` function item. When the `setmetatable` function sets `Metatable` to `Table`, the events (metamethods) in `Metatable` are called, in this case `__call`, which executes when the table is called like a function.

`__call` is not the only event (metamethod). There are more as documented in the [Roblox Developer Wiki](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/Metatables#metamethods).

### pcall

You might want to know what `pcall` does, and it is actually extremely simple.

Take this example:

```lua
pcall(function(Words)
    print(Words)
end, "pcalls are cool!")
```

Right here, we're simply creating an anonymous function (a function that only runs once, inside of the `pcall`) and providing it to `pcall`.  
If you notice the comma after `end`, you'll also see that another argument was passed. All extra arguments that `pcall` has are passed to the provided function.

We could also use this code, which functions the exact same way but you'll be able to run the function again afterwards:

```lua
local function MyCoolFuction(Words)
    print(Words)
end

pcall(MyCoolFunction, "pcalls are cool!")
```

But, you may be thinking, what are the advantages of using `pcall` over just a normal function call (or just executing code)?

That reason is error handling.

When you create a `pcall`, you're also able to assign its return value to a variable.

`pcall` returns two things, a boolean (`true` if the function had no errors and `false` otherwise), and a varying value that, if the function had no errors, is `nil`, otherwise the error message.

So, we can get those values like so:

```lua
local function MyCoolFuction(Words)
    print(Words)
end

local success, message = pcall(MyCoolFunction, "pcalls are cool!")
```

In this example, no errors will be created when calling the function, so `success` is `true` and `message` is `nil`. However, if we were to make a function like so:

```lua
local function MyCoolFunction(Words)
    error(Words)
end

local success, message = pcall(MyCoolFunction, "this function will error now.")
```

Here, since the function errors (in this case we explicitly call `error`), `success` is `false` and `message` is `"this function will error now."`. We could've also used `assert(nil, "this function will error now.")` instead of `error` (as `assert` is a function that will error if the first argument is `nil` or `false`, and errors with the second argument as the message).

Remember, we can still use anonymous functions if you don't need to use the function multiple times:

```lua
local success, message = pcall(function(Words)
    error(Words)
end, "this function will error now.")
```

like before, this function will make `success` `false` and `message` `"this function will error now."`.

Similarly, there is another function called `xpcall`. Put simply, this is `pcall` with a second function argument. This second argument will handle errors from the `pcall` and Roblox will not do anything else with it. There is a second return value you can learn more about at [the Roblox Developer Wiki](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/lua-docs/Lua-Globals#variables) as that is out of the tutorial's scope.

```lua
local function MyCoolFunction(Words)
    error(Words)
end

local function ErrorHandler(Message)
    print("[Error Handler] "..Message)
end

local success = xpcall(MyCoolFunction, ErrorHandler, "Just stop the function.")
```

You also might want to know why this is useful, but this isn't really something I can just explain. It is useful when it is useful. Anyway, the example makes it so that the error handler prints `[Error Handler] Script: "Just stop the function."`. `success` is `false`, as would be expected.
