# Don't link to "Here"

*Why you shouldn't use "here" for links*

TL;DR: Stop saying you can download something "[here](https://example.com/)" or that you should "[click here](https://example.com/)" to see something since it doesn't make sense in most occasions, like mobile devices, screen readers, or grammar cohesion.

When you're creating almost anything on the internet, you can probably link to another resource. We see it all the time. If you want the user to click something but don't know how to phrase it, "Click here" is probably the first thing that comes to mind. While this seems completely fine, there are a few reasons this is a terrible option. In fact, both of these words are taboo with their own reasons.

Clicking is something that nearly half the internet can't do, so it doesn't make much sense to specify that you should be clicking a link. Saying "tap here" is still just as bad, because it isn't as common and you may even see more people questioning why you used "tap" or "touch". What about screen readers, too? They don't do much clicking, either.

"Here" is also a terrible way to tell the user what that link actually is. Have you ever seen someone do something like this?:

> You can download it [here](https://example.com/)...

Now, while this technically doesn't exactly conceal what the link is doing, the user could be led to click the link without reading what they're doing. I've done it multiple times, especially when I was first learning about computers.

A better alternative would be to do the following:

> You can download it at the [GitHub Releases page](https://example.com/)...

or

> You can [download it](https://example.com/), then [install it](https://example.com/), and you should be able to [lorem ipsum](https://example.com/) afterwards.

While it isn't often seen, you can sometimes come across lists of "here"s.

> You can find it [here](https://example.com/), [here](https://example.com/), or [here](https://example.com/).

At this point, it's just much easier to read when you specify what the links are, unless the resource they are linking to is incredibly unimportant or virtually the same.

> You can find it on [GitHub](https://example.com/), [GitLab](https://example.com/), or [Bitbucket](https://example.com/).

An easy way to do this is to link to nouns (and their surrounding words), like this:

> Welcome to my website! Here, you can read [my resume](https://example.com/) or read [my blog](https://example.com/).

In this example, it wouldn't matter much if "read" was also a part of the links. Just make sure you don't link too much. At maximum 5 words should be a good threshold.

Example paragraph:

Hello and welcome to my profile! I have [my own blog](https://example.com/) and [email address](mailto:me@example.com), along with my custom-made web toolkit, which you can find on [GitHub](https://example.com/) or [GitLab](https://example.com/). I use Mozilla Firefox and some developer-orientated add-ons, like [DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/). I love Tron and ice cream.

Notice how I didn't link what didn't need to be linked, like ice cream. I also didn't continue linking the punctuation (periods, commas) but you don't need to omit them.
