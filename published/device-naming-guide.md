# Device Naming Guidelines

*The guidelines in which I name my devices*

## Quick Syntax

TP-OS(ver)_Name.

PC-Win_EthanMB would be a Windows (latest) named "EthanMB".

## OS

| Type | Name | Abbreviation | Note |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Computer | Windows | WIN |
| Computer | MacOS | MAC |
| Computer | Linux | LNX |
| Computer | Linux (Ubuntu) | UBN |
| Computer | Linux (Debian) | DEB |
| Computer | Linux (Mint) | LMT |
| Phone | Android | AND |
| Phone | Android | AN[C] | [C] = codename first letter |
| Phone | iOS | iOS |
| TV | KODI | KDI |
{: rules="groups"}

You can lowercase the first letter of the OS. This is recommended.

## ver

If necessary, also provide the version of the OS after the OS itself, like so: MP-iOS14_Name. This can also be used to avoid the codename insanity with Android, where MP-AND8_Name (Android Oreo) could be used instead of MP-ANO_Name.

## TP

The 'type' of device it is. Use two-character formats, but 3-5 if it is absolutely necessary.

| Name | Abbreviation |
|:--|:--|
| Server | SV, SRV |
| Workstation | WS, WKS |
| Computer | PC |
| Laptop | LT |
| Tablet | TB |
| Phone (Mobile) | MP |
| Phone (Home) | HP |
| Phone (Work) | WP |
| Phone (Telephone) | TL, TEL |
| Television / Dongle | TV |
| Printer | PT, PTR, PRNT |
| Virtual Machine | VM |
| Other | DV |
{: rules="groups"}

Do not make any of the letters here lowercase unless it is required by the computer.

## Name

Simple- give your device a name.

This also works with fLast, like PC-Win_jDoe (a Windows computer owned by John Doe). If preferred, you can also use the full name or add the middle name.

It is recommended to append `.admin`, `.administrator`, or `.sudo` to the profile name when there is an alternative account that does not have administrator permissions (and this one does). This should only really be used in enterprise situations.
