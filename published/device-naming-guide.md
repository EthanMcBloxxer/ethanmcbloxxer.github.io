# Name
Simple- give your device a name. Alternatively, this can also be fLast, like this: WIN.PC-jDoe (a Windows computer owned by John Doe). Further, naming accounts can also be done like this, but prefix or suffixed with "admin" if the account is an admin type: jDoe.Admin or Admin.jDoe. jDoe would be the normal account name.

# Can't Use A Period?
Don't; just use an underscore (_) or if really necessary a hyphen (-).
