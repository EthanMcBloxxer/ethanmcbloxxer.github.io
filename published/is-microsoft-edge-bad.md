# Is Microsoft Edge bad?
*Could Edge be a normal webbrowser?*

Most people hate on Edge for a number of reasons, but is it actually bad?  

Well, my answer to this question is **no**.
Edge is introducing more features, better user interface, and even much better browsing power by switching to a revision of Chromium (the open-source project that powers Chrome). Microsoft even tries to make it very easy for people to switch from web browsers like chrome, because they can merge favorite sites, passwords, and more from Chrome, Firefox, IE, older versions of Edge, and even HTML files of favorites, which means that you can import these from almost any web browser.  
Then, because Edge is using Chromium, you can install Chrome-Based addons/extensions to Edge, as well as the native Microsoft-Based extensions from the Microsoft Store and other locations. However, Edge still doesn't want to use better search engines by default, like [Google](https://www.google.com/), [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com/), or [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/). Again, this is by default, so it is actually changeable the same way that Chrome is (from the dropdown in [edge://settings/search](edge://settings/search)).  
More and more features are also added, such as much better privacy protection practices and better changeable interface parts. Still, though, Edge uses InPrivate tabs that don't actually gain you security unless you want security from others looking at your computer which could cause confusion as all other "incognito" tabs do: your ISP can still see your browsing history along with other things, but your cache, cookies, etc. are deleted.  
Remember that when you use Edge to go through all of it's settings because there are a few things you need to tweak, such as Edge running in the background while closed.  
Either way, Edge could become one of the most used browsers ever, not just something to download Google Chrome with.
