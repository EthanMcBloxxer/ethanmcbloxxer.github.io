Have you ever wished Windows had slight alterations? Well, here are 10 different applications that wished the same thing!

## [f.lux](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/flux/9n9kdphv91jt) {#flux}
f.lux (or flux) is a great app that alters the amount of blue light that your display emits by time of day, saving your eyes no matter what time of day.  
It's open-source, and you can get it on the [Microsoft Store (recommended)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/flux/9n9kdphv91jt) or the [f.lux official website](https://justgetflux.com/).
It even works cross-platform, so if you have a Mac or Linux as well then you can also use it on them, making it a universal add-on.

## [EarTrumpet](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/eartrumpet/9nblggh516xp) {#eartrumpet}
Now, this one's title sounds pretty complicated, but it really isn't.
All it does is change the normal volume icon that appears in your taskbar to allow application-specific volume changes and application volume output rerouting, similar to the behavior of Windows' Volume Mixer.
This means that you can change the volume of specific applications and move them to other output devices, such as from your headphones to your speakers.
It is created in UWP, Universal Windows Platform, so it may lag on lower-end computers.

## [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) {#sevenzip}
While this isn't an extension to stay completely true to the UI of, say, file explorer, it is still **very** useful for extracting any sort of compressed file professionally, like `.zip`s, `.rar`s, `.cab`, `.7z`, etc. It has it's own compressed file type, called `7z`, which is currently superior to any other compression, however you are only able to decompress it via the 7zip application itself. And, it is open-source too.

## [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) {#autohotkey}
You've probably heard of this program before. It runs a custom scripting language to take advantage of all keys and specific mouse movements to make precise macros. Still, this isn't really a simple addon, but it does help with a number of things. Just remember to never put any scripts into it unless you can understand what is acutally happening. Otherwise, you could get all your data leaked. No, it's not a virus. In fact, it's open-source.

## [EdgeDeflector](https://github.com/da2x/EdgeDeflector/releases/download/v1.1.3.0/EdgeDeflector_install.exe) {#edgedeflector}
This is probably the least noticable thing so far. All this program does is change all the default times that Windows runs Edge, then instead takes that information and passes it to your system's default web browser. It doesn't even run in the background, it's just lauched in place of Edge whenever Windows runs it. Then, once the information is passed to your web browser, it closes. Simple, and yes, open-source.

## [Black Notepad](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/black-notepad/9p20vw17vmpk) {#blacknotepad}
Black Notepad is the only one of it's kind, and it doesn't... look that good. It's basically Windows' Notepad app, but designed to be darker. I love the idea, but it just looks... terrible. If you want it, then you can download it, but I don't recommend it.

## [Files (Preview)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/files-preview/9nghp3dx8hdx) {#files}
Currently in a preview, but still looking **great**. This is a Universal Windows Platform app, or Metro app, that completely redoes File Explorer (as a standalone). It has a tab system to switch between different windows, like Downloads and your .minecraft %appdata% folder for getting all those mods you just downloaded. It also works with Dark Mode which is a huge plus. There is only one gripe that I have with it currently, and that is speed. While File Explorer can list every single file in a directory almost seemlessly without questioning the size, this application takes ~¼sec to actually render every file, although this could be because it creates a preview for each file. It's even got a micro-task manager instead of a seperate window for ongoing copy/paste/move/etc tasks.

## [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701) {#windowsterminal}
This is a tab-style rework of all of the terminals that are on your device, like Command Prompt, PowerShell, Ubuntu, Azure PowerShell, etc. And, it works with our previously mentioned Files, where you go into the menu and click Open in Terminal... where it will launch the current directory inside of Windows Terminal. Sadly, this app is mostly built for developers because of it's lack of a user-friendly settings menu. You instead have to find the app's UUID and add it via JSON, but it still does support non-native terminals, like Ubuntu.

## [Modern Flyouts](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/modernflyouts/9mt60qv066rp) {#modernflyouts}
A simple app to just changes the flyouts (volume changer, airplane mode, caps/num/scroll lock, insert, etc) to be more modern. A simple change, a lightweight change, and a beautiful change.

## [WinDynamicDesktop](https://github.com/t1m0thyj/WinDynamicDesktop/releases)
Amazing extension app that ports over the "Dynamic" desktop backgrounds from MacOS. This means that it changes the shades and appearance of your desktop background by time of day. Some even have sunrise/set integrated too! Yet again- open-source.

## [Browser for Game Bar](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/browser-for-game-bar/9nk1cnb0nccx) {#b4gb}
Simple and elegant Game Bar (⊞G) extension that integrates a new web browser widget so you can watch videos, movies, music, etc. while playing games by pinning it.
