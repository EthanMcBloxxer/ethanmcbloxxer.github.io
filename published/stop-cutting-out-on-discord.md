# Easily stop cutting out on Discord

*No longer will you stop being heard in the middle of sentences!*

So you've experienced cutting out. Either your friends tell you that you are, or you hear your friends cutting out. Today, I'll tell you the secret to stop cutting out on Discord.

To begin, you want to click on User Settings in the bottom corner of your Discord app.

You'll see your account settings, but right now that's not what we want. Navigate to Voice & Video.

Now, untoggle the "Automatically determine input sensitivity" switch.

Then, if you want 0 cut-outs ever, you can drag the white bar all the way down to the end:

Or to a good threshold based on the moving greener bar. If you aren't talking then move the white bar to where the darker green line ends, or you can **never** cut out like I mentioned previously.

Hope this helped. If it didn't, try:
* Restarting Discord with CTRL+R
* Running Discord with administrative rights
* Re-logging into Discord
* Restarting your computer
* Reinstalling Discord
