# The Great Discord War
*Accidentally recreating human history on Discord*  
*Created on March 3rd, 2021*

It all started from humble beginnings, in a simple, limited messaging group on chat platform Discord. We all talked this way for a long time, until we, 10 people, all unanimously decided that we should create a server to bring about many upgrades such as multiple (text and voice) channels, more members, and customizable permissions.

I was the one to make that server, called "The Gang". It had a neat logo, a bit like the introduction to a Star Wars film: the Star Wars font displaying "The Gang", a sans-serif font saying "The Best Chat", and a night sky background dotted with stars. The permissions were fine, everyone was happy, and we had a stable server. Organization, music, bots. Everyone had what they wanted.

Or so it seemed.

What I didn't know, is that some of the ~~subjects~~ **members** of the new server didn't like how the permissions were set up. We had a main role which most of the members had, with almost all of the permissions except deleting anything or moderation permissions, like moving, muting, kicking, or banning.

This led them to create another server in secret, after I broke the last straw when getting in a ~~fight~~ **petty quarrel** with the person who created the next server. The server was called "The New Gang" (with the next minute meme as the logo), that mainly attempted a democratic approach. We had a really odd war, as it was mostly just talking in chat. I ended up failing to get many people to side with me, so the democratic server began. A democratic chat group. I felt it a bit excessive, but they did it, and when I suggested other democratic things to do, they said it was excessive. Okay. I had thought the server might fail at some point, and it did. But the entire thing was supposed to be a joke from the beginning.

A frog revolution.

A channel appeared one day called `#frog-revolt`, with a message telling everyone to join the frogs and change their profile picture to Gamatatsu from Naruto. Somehow, this revolution got around to deleting the server. I have no idea how, but the server was now gone, and quite a few Discord profile pictures had turned to Gamatatsu. Well, because we didn't have a server anymore, a new server was created. This time by someone who I generally thought didn't really care about this entire thing too much. The server in question had a burning car as the logo. Rightfully so, too, as that server quickly became unused as each person who actually cared created their own server. In the end, we somehow have all of these servers now, ordered in usage:

* Avocado
* Bean
* Potato
* Otter

The names are simplified, but we somehow ended up with a ton of food-related names for servers. As you could tell, the Avocado server is the most used, and was created by the initial person who made The New Gang. Now, we all live in general peace.

Everyone agrees that it kind of looks like human history, so we gave our old servers country names, which might be pretty historically inacurate but seems to fall into place well:

The Gang
: Britain

The New Gang
: America

Burning Car
: Russia

Avocado
: Canada

But we don't have any of the present-day servers as countries yet, other than Avocado. That might be because I'm only in the Avocado server.

Anyways, I hope you enjoyed more than I did. I'm still confused at why we can't just have a single server. I might even try to go back to a simple 10-person group.
