For [EthanMcBloxxer/antibot-endpoint](https://github.com/EthanMcBloxxer/antibot-endpoint).

An API endpoint of codehouseRBLX/AntiBot's API.

You can change `APIurl` to `https://antibot-endpoint.ethanmcbloxxer.repl.co` inside of your `AntiBotMain.lua`.

This doesn't have any advantages to using, but it does contain much less files.  
The primary use case would be that you want a custom domain for your AntiBot, like `scammer-sword.yourname.repl.co`.

I **highly** recommend making an `HTTPRequest` to this endpoint at `/ping` when the game starts. Replit could put your repl to sleep if you don't have the "Hacker" plan otherwise.
