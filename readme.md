Public storage repository hosted on GitHub and indexed by [jindex](https://github.com/EthanMcBloxxer/jindex). Files/folders bigger than 100MB are compressed, often with lmza/xz, for GitHub compatibility. Large file system objects are a last-resort, but are procedurally added to `.gitattributes` based on the commit.

Feel free to fork the repository at any point to save a snapshot of its history.  
Please don't do this in to save accidentally uploaded files or folders.
