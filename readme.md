Public storage repository hosted on GitHub and indexed by [jindex](https://github.com/EthanMcBloxxer/jindex). Files or folders bigger than 100MB are compressed, often with [lmza/xz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel–Ziv–Markov_chain_algorithm), for GitHub compatibility. You might need to download [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org) or a similar program to extract these. <!-- xz benchmarks at about 90% better then zip or other common formats with 7z ultra compression -->

Large file system objects are a last-resort, but are procedurally added to `.gitattributes` based on the commit.
